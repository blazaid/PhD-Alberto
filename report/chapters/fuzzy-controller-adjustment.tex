\chapter{Reglas del \acrlongsp{fcs}\index{sistema de control borroso} inferido}
\label{ch:derived-controller-rules}

Esta sección ofrece un listado de las reglas borrosas generadas en el proceso de inferencia del \acrlongsp{fcs}\index{sistema de control borroso} para el modelo longitudinal del conductor genérico descrito en la sección \nameref{s:fcs-based-model} del capítulo \nameref{ch:longitudinal-model}.

Las reglas están ponderadas con pesos de dos decimales de precisión. Éstas se han simplificado aplicando las siguientes premisas:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Toda regla con un peso de $0$ ha sido eliminada por no activar ningún conjunto de salida.
	\item Todo par de reglas con igual antecedente y peso similar que activa ambos conjuntos borrosos\index{conjunto borroso} de salida se anula y por tanto puede ser descartada.
	\item Todo par de reglas con el mismo peso asociado que difieren en una única variable de entrada, se convierten en una única regla sin dicha variable al no afectar ésta a la activación del consecuente.
\end{itemize}

Tras este proceso, el total de $256$ reglas posibles\sidenote{$2^{8}$ posibles combinaciones de $7$ variables de entrada y $1$ variable de salida, cada una particionada en $2$ conjuntos borrosos.} de las que se compone el sistema se reduce a las $67$ reglas siguientes:
