@article{al2001framework,
	abstract = {A framework for modeling driver behavior within driving simulators is described in this paper. This framework serves as a basis for building human-like driving behavior models for autonomous vehicles operating within the virtual environment of a driving simulator. The framework consists of four units, the Perception Unit, the Emotions Unit, the Decision-making Unit (DMU), and the Decision-implementation Unit (DIU). The Perception Unit defines how the model perceives its environment in local and global terms. The Emotions Unit defines how the model responds emotionally to its environment. The DMU investigates the environment for possible actions that might potentially serve the model's emotional demands. And finally the DIU tries to implement these decisions when a traffic condition, perceived as safe enough for such an implementation, emerges. Each of these units has its own set of fuzzy variables and fuzzy ifthen rules. Any driving model, that is based on this framework, should provide membership function parameters for these fuzzy variables in accordance with the category of human driving behavior this model is targeting. Our framework addresses decision making and implementation at the maneuvering and operational levels of the driving task. Decisions at the planning level are addressed through a script-based traffic controller. The present model is limited to simulating human behaviors when driving in a two-lane rural environment.},

First, a parameter estimation algorithm for the SS-ARX model with multiple measured input-output sequences is developed based on the expectation-maximization algorithm. This can be achieved by extending the parameter estimation technique for the conventional hidden Markov model. Second, the developed parameter estimation algorithm is applied to driving data with the focus being on driver's collision avoidance behavior. The driving data were collected using a driving simulator based on the cave automatic virtual environment, which is a stereoscopic immersive virtual reality system. Then, the parameter set for each driver is obtained, and certain driving characteristics are identified from the viewpoint of switched control mechanism. Finally, the performance of the SS-ARX model as a behavior recognizer is examined. The results show that the SS-ARX model holds remarkable potential to function as a behavior recognizer.},

This attention needs to be reflected upon at particular points in time. CF models are in a continuous state of improvement due to their significant role in traffic micro-simulations, intelligent transportation systems and safety engineering models. This paper presents a review of existing CF models. It classifies them into classic and artificial intel-ligence models. It discusses the capability of the models and potential limitations that need to be con-sidered in their improvement. This paper also reviews the studies investigating the impacts of heavy vehicles in traffic stream and on CF behaviour. The findings of the study provide promising directions for future research and suggest revisiting the existing models to accommodate different behaviours of drivers in heterogeneous traffic, in particular, heavy vehicles in traffic.},

It is shown theoretically that the motion of a long line of vehicles becomes unstable when the product of the lag time and the proportionality constant exceeds one-half. The experimental data implies that driving is done on the verge of instability. A variety of other laws of following is analyzed theoretically.},

Most of the models use mathematical formulas and conventional logic rules to represent the driver knowledge and the models are calibrated by measured data on variables predetermined by the expert knowledge. However, human drivers have the characteristics of making decision based on the imprecise perceptions of the surrounding environments and they also behave in an integrated way, which means that they are taking care of lane changing and car following at the same time. In this research, a fuzzy inference system is proposed to represent the human driving knowledge including both car following and lane changing behaviour. Neural network is used to calibrate and tune the structure and parameters of the fuzzy inference system.},

We decided to estimate the total number of neocortical neurons in the normal human brain and to analyze it with respect to the major macro- and microscopical structural components, to study the internal relationships of these components, and to quantitate the influence of important physiological variables on brain structure. The 94 brains reported represent a consecutive collection of brains from the general Danish population. The average numbers of neocortical neurons were 19 billion in female brains and 23 billion in male brains, a 16{\%} difference. In our study, which covered the age range from 20 years to 90 years, approximately 10{\%} of all neocortical neurons are lost over the life span in both sexes. Sex and age were the main determinants of the total number of neurons in the human neocortex, whereas body size, per se, had no influence on neuron number. Some of the data presented have been analyzed by using new mathematical designs. An equation predicting the total neocortical neuron number in any individual in which sex and age are known is provided.},

The resulting word-level distributed representations often ignore morpho-logical information, though character-level em-beddings have proven valuable to NLP tasks. We propose a new neural language model in-corporating both word order and character or-der in its embedding. The model produces sev-eral vector spaces with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 85.8{\%} on a recent word-analogy task, exceeding best pub-lished syntactic word-analogy scores by a 58{\%} error margin (Pennington et al., 2014). Further-more, the model includes several parallel training methods, most notably allowing a skip-gram net-work with 160 billion parameters to be trained overnight on 3 multi-core CPUs, 14x larger than the previous largest neural network (Coates et al., 2013).},

The vehicles motion is given by car-following differential systems that incorporate a targeted state function and a strictly positive reaction time. Through simulations, we observe two types of stationary state for a line of vehicle evolving on a ring: a homogeneous state in which vehicle speed and gap are constant and equal and a heterogeneous state in which kinematic waves spread out. The reaction time and the form of the targeted state function seem to be the determining microscopic factors of the macroscopic stationary state stability. A stability linear analysis of the homogeneous state is done with a basic car-following model. The results indicate an explicit condition between the reaction time, the form of the targeted state function and the stationary state nature of the vehicle line.},

Recently, a cellular automaton model for two-lane traffic was able to overcome some of these problems and to generate the density inversion found in many European countries at densities somewhat below the maximum flow density. In this paper we summarize different approaches to lane changing and their results and propose a general scheme, according to which realistic lane changing rules can be developed. We test this scheme by applying it to several different lane changing rules, which, in spite of their differences, generate similar and realistic results. We thus conclude that, for producing realistic results, the logical structure of the lane changing rules, as proposed here, is at least as important as the microscopic details of the rules.},

@article{Helbing2001,
	abstract = {Since the subject of traffic dynamics has captured the interest of physicists, many astonishing effects have been revealed and explained. Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by so-called ``phantom traffic jams'', although they all like to drive fast? What are the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how are they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction of the traffic volume cause a lasting traffic jam? Under which conditions can speed limits speed up traffic? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize in lanes, while similar systems are ``freezing by heating''? Why do self-organizing systems tend to reach an optimal state? Why do panicking pedestrians produce dangerous deadlocks? All these questions have been answered by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics to self-driven many-particle systems. This review article on traffic introduces (i) empirically data, facts, and observations, (ii) the main approaches to pedestrian, highway, and city traffic, (iii) microscopic (particle-based), mesoscopic (gas-kinetic), and macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) models. Attention is also paid to the formulation of a micro-macro link, to aspects of universality, and to other unifying concepts like a general modelling framework for self-driven many-particle systems, including spin systems. Subjects such as the optimization of traffic flows and relations to biological or socio-economic systems such as bacterial colonies, flocks of birds, panics, and stock market dynamics are discussed as well.},

@article{Dia2002,
	abstract = {This paper presents an agent-based approach to modelling individual driver behaviour under the influence of real-time traffic information. The driver behaviour models developed in this study are based on a behavioural survey of drivers which was conducted on a congested commuting corridor in Brisbane, Australia. Commuters' responses to travel information were analysed and a number of discrete choice models were developed to determine the factors influencing drivers' behaviour and their propensity to change route and adjust travel patterns. Based on the results obtained from the behavioural survey, the agent behaviour parameters which define driver characteristics, knowledge and preferences were identified and their values determined. A case study implementing a simple agent-based route choice decision model within a microscopic traffic simulation tool is also presented. Driver-vehicle units (DVUs) were modelled as autonomous software components that can each be assigned a set of goals to achieve and a database of knowledge comprising certain beliefs, intentions and preferences concerning the driving task. Each DVU provided route choice decision-making capabilities, based on perception of its environment, that were similar to the described intentions of the driver it represented. The case study clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and the potential to develop more complex driver behavioural dynamics based on the belief–desire–intention agent architecture.},

This work is part of a larger effort, the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort which is aimed at developing techniques and methodology for building large-scale knowledge bases which are sharable and reusable. KQML is both a message format and a message-handling protocol to support run-time knowledge sharing among agents. KQML focuses on an extensible set of performatives, which defines the permissible “speech acts” agents may use and comprise a substrate on which to develop higher-level models of interagent interaction such as contract nets and negotiation. In addition, KQML provides a basic architecture for knowledge sharing through a special class of agent called communication facilitors which coordinate the interactions of other agents. The ideas which underlie the evolving design of KQML are currently being explored through experimental prototype systems which are being used to support several testbeds in such areas as concurrent engineering, intelligent design and intelligent planning and scheduling.},

Many types of individual agent and MAS models have been proposed since the mid-1980s, but the majority of these have led to single developer homogeneous MAS systems. For over a decade, the FIPA standards activity has worked to produce public MAS specifications, acting as a key enabler to support interoperability, open service interaction, and to support heterogeneous development. The main characteristics of the FIPA model for MAS and an analysis of design, design choices and features of the model is presented. In addition, a comparison of the FIPA model for system interoperability versus those of other standards bodies is presented, along with a discussion of the current status of FIPA and future directions.},

After a detailed formulation and explanation of its implementation, we will then compare the proposed algorithm with other existing algorithms, including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization.

@book{Holland1975,
	abstract = {Genetic algorithms were developed initially by Holland et al. in the 1960s and 1970s!!! Genetic algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements. John H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He is also Maxwell Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and is Director of the University of Michigan/Santa Fe Institute Advanced Research Program.},

@article{Toledo2007,
	abstract = {This paper develops, implements and tests a framework for driving behavior modeling that integrates the various decisions, such as acceleration, lane changing and gap acceptance. Furthermore, the proposed framework is based on the concepts of short-term goal and short-term plan. Drivers are assumed to conceive and perform short-term plans in order to accomplish short-term goals. This behavioral framework supports a more realistic representation of the driving task, since it captures drivers' planning capabilities and allows decisions to be based on anticipated future conditions. An integrated driving behavior model, which utilizes these concepts, is developed. The model captures both lane changing and acceleration behaviors. The driver's short-term goal is defined by the target lane. Drivers who wish to change lanes but cannot change lanes immediately, select a short-term plan to perform the desired lane change. Short-term plans are defined by the various gaps in traffic in the target lane. Drivers adapt their acceleration behavior to facilitate the lane change using the target gap. Hence, inter-dependencies between lane changing and acceleration behaviors are captured. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The model is intended to cover the urban driving situation, where traffic signals, obstructions and heavy vehicles all exert an influence. The structure is designed to ensure that the vehicles in traffic simulations behave logically when confronted with situations commonly encountered in real traffic. The specific mathematical expression of the questions embedded in the decision process and employed in the present implementation of the model are not critical and can be replaced by alternatives, but the heirarchy of the decisions is crucial. On the basis of experience to date, the lane changing model produces a realistic simulation of driver behaviour and has proved very robust under a wide range of conditions. ?? 1986.},
