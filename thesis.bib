This attention needs to be reflected upon at particular points in time. CF models are in a continuous state of improvement due to their significant role in traffic micro-simulations, intelligent transportation systems and safety engineering models. This paper presents a review of existing CF models. It classifies them into classic and artificial intel-ligence models. It discusses the capability of the models and potential limitations that need to be con-sidered in their improvement. This paper also reviews the studies investigating the impacts of heavy vehicles in traffic stream and on CF behaviour. The findings of the study provide promising directions for future research and suggest revisiting the existing models to accommodate different behaviours of drivers in heterogeneous traffic, in particular, heavy vehicles in traffic.},

Experimental data is presented which indicates that the acceleration at time t of a car which is attempting to follow a leader is proportional to the difference in velocity of the two cars at a time (t-$\Delta$), $\Delta$ being about 1.5 sec and the proportionality constant being about 0.37 sec-1. It is shown theoretically that the motion of a long line of vehicles becomes unstable when the product of the lag time and the proportionality constant exceeds one-half. The experimental data implies that driving is done on the verge of instability. A variety of other laws of following is analyzed theoretically.},

This capability is in contrast to existing agent-based simulators of traffic flows, where the values of their parameters are calibrated with iterative simulation. Second, Megaffic can run on massively parallel computers and simulate the microscopic traffic flows in the scale of an arbitrary city or even the whole Japan.

	abstract = {Objectives In the past decades, car following and lane changing behaviours, the soul of microscopic traffic simulation, have been intensively studied and different forms of models have been proposed and implemented. Most of the models use mathematical formulas and conventional logic rules to represent the driver knowledge and the models are calibrated by measured data on variables predetermined by the expert knowledge. However, human drivers have the characteristics of making decision based on the imprecise perceptions of the surrounding environments and they also behave in an integrated way, which means that they are taking care of lane changing and car following at the same time. In this research, a fuzzy inference system is proposed to represent the human driving knowledge including both car following and lane changing behaviour. Neural network is used to calibrate and tune the structure and parameters of the fuzzy inference system.},

We decided to estimate the total number of neocortical neurons in the normal human brain and to analyze it with respect to the major macro- and microscopical structural components, to study the internal relationships of these components, and to quantitate the influence of important physiological variables on brain structure. The 94 brains reported represent a consecutive collection of brains from the general Danish population. The average numbers of neocortical neurons were 19 billion in female brains and 23 billion in male brains, a 16{\%} difference. In our study, which covered the age range from 20 years to 90 years, approximately 10{\%} of all neocortical neurons are lost over the life span in both sexes. Sex and age were the main determinants of the total number of neurons in the human neocortex, whereas body size, per se, had no influence on neuron number. Some of the data presented have been analyzed by using new mathematical designs. An equation predicting the total neocortical neuron number in any individual in which sex and age are known is provided.},

The resulting word-level distributed representations often ignore morpho-logical information, though character-level em-beddings have proven valuable to NLP tasks. We propose a new neural language model in-corporating both word order and character or-der in its embedding. The model produces sev-eral vector spaces with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 85.8{\%} on a recent word-analogy task, exceeding best pub-lished syntactic word-analogy scores by a 58{\%} error margin (Pennington et al., 2014). Further-more, the model includes several parallel training methods, most notably allowing a skip-gram net-work with 160 billion parameters to be trained overnight on 3 multi-core CPUs, 14x larger than the previous largest neural network (Coates et al., 2013).},

	abstract = {We propose to study the emergence of kinematic waves in microscopic models of traffic flow. The vehicles motion is given by car-following differential systems that incorporate a targeted state function and a strictly positive reaction time. Through simulations, we observe two types of stationary state for a line of vehicle evolving on a ring: a homogeneous state in which vehicle speed and gap are constant and equal and a heterogeneous state in which kinematic waves spread out. The reaction time and the form of the targeted state function seem to be the determining microscopic factors of the macroscopic stationary state stability. A stability linear analysis of the homogeneous state is done with a basic car-following model. The results indicate an explicit condition between the reaction time, the form of the targeted state function and the stationary state nature of the vehicle line.},

Such states have not been observed in the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model which is the basic cellular automaton for the description of traffic. Here we propose a simple generalization of the NaSch model by introducing a velocity-dependent randomization. We investigate a special case which belongs to the so-called slow-to-start rules. It is shown that this model exhibits metastable states, thus sheding some light on the prerequisites for the occurance of hysteresis effects in the flow-density relation.},

@article{Nagel1998,
	abstract = {Microscopic modeling of multilane traffic is usually done by applying heuristic lane changing rules and often with unsatisfying results. Recently, a cellular automaton model for two-lane traffic was able to overcome some of these problems and to generate the density inversion found in many European countries at densities somewhat below the maximum flow density. In this paper we summarize different approaches to lane changing and their results and propose a general scheme, according to which realistic lane changing rules can be developed. We test this scheme by applying it to several different lane changing rules, which, in spite of their differences, generate similar and realistic results. We thus conclude that, for producing realistic results, the logical structure of the lane changing rules, as proposed here, is at least as important as the microscopic details of the rules.},

@article{Helbing2001,
	abstract = {Since the subject of traffic dynamics has captured the interest of physicists, many astonishing effects have been revealed and explained. Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by so-called ``phantom traffic jams'', although they all like to drive fast? What are the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how are they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction of the traffic volume cause a lasting traffic jam? Under which conditions can speed limits speed up traffic? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize in lanes, while similar systems are ``freezing by heating''? Why do self-organizing systems tend to reach an optimal state? Why do panicking pedestrians produce dangerous deadlocks? All these questions have been answered by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics to self-driven many-particle systems. This review article on traffic introduces (i) empirically data, facts, and observations, (ii) the main approaches to pedestrian, highway, and city traffic, (iii) microscopic (particle-based), mesoscopic (gas-kinetic), and macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) models. Attention is also paid to the formulation of a micro-macro link, to aspects of universality, and to other unifying concepts like a general modelling framework for self-driven many-particle systems, including spin systems. Subjects such as the optimization of traffic flows and relations to biological or socio-economic systems such as bacterial colonies, flocks of birds, panics, and stock market dynamics are discussed as well.},
